Welcome to JamCharts!
=====================

Are you sick of playing the same old tired three-chord tunes because the other cats don't 
know the changes to the hipper songs you dig?

Why are you still scrawling chord changes on napkins or dragging around a dog-eared binder 
and killing trees making copies?

Dude, it's time to join the 21st century where everyone has a tablet or a smartphone and 
the internet is everywhere you want to be. 

Pick any chart from the library or add your own songs
--------------------------------------------------

In the same time you'd waste scribbling changes on a sheet of paper, you could enter a tune in JamCharts and have it 
available to everyone, everywhere, forever.

Think of JamCharts as Wikipedia for chord charts. Anyone can create or edit any page. A full change history is 
maintained for every song, so it's easy to undo mistakes.

JamCharts is a labor of love. It will always remain completely free and unblemished by banner ads. Hosting is 
sponsored by [Gibraltar Software](http://www.gibraltarsoftware.com). The site is maintained by [Jay Cincotta](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jaycincotta) and 
a group of other hacker/musicians who generously donate their time and talents.

We have a backlog of feature ideas a mile long, but our time is limited. If you'd like to help, please [email Jay](email:jay@gibraltarsoftware.com).
Special thanks to Richard Sigler for bringing "Real Book" fonts to the web. You can check out Richard's work
